## Final Project - Analyzing Electrical Grid 

This is the final capstone project for the Advanced Data Science Specialization from IBM. 

This project attempts to predict the stability of the nodes of a 4 node star electrical system. 

EDA is first performed with Pandas. 

The GBT pipeline is made with spark

The neural network was made using pytorch. 

## Code instructions

Download the repository to your desktop. Then you need to install Pandas, SKlearn and Pytorch.
